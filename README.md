## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Mohammed and welcome to my GitHub!

This GitHub account is being used to create notes on the processes I have implemented during my time as a DevOps Engineer. <br> <br>

Here, you will find projects ranging from fun Pokemon API games, to building your own Jenkins pipeline!

The projects will have step-by-step guides to allow you to follow along and try it out yourself :tada:. 

Please check out the projects I have created on my journey as a DevOps Engineer! :grin:
